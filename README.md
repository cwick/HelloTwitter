Twitter client to learn iOS development

**Disclaimer:** At the time I wrote this app I had only been learning iOS for about a week. You may experience some "wtf" moments when reading the code.

1. `pod install`
1. `open HelloTwitter.xcworkspace`

The app saves the last search results in Core Data. Profile images are loaded with [SDWebImage](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage).
